# Discord-Webhook-IP-Logger
This is a PHP IP logger I made that sends the IP's to a Discord webhook.  
# Features
- Grabs the IP then gets info about it after that it sends it to a webhook you have entered in the file.  
- Gets Geo Location & ISP aswell as information regarding if its a VPN/Home Connection  
- Filters out bots  
# How to use
Step 1: Go into the settings of your Discord server, click webhooks and create one then copy the link to it.  
Step 2: Put in the field of `$webhookurl = "";` with https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/ included at the beginning.
Step 3: Upload the file to your website (you can use external webhosting such as 000webhost if you dont have a website/domain)
